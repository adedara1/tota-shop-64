I don't have the full content of the `src/pages/StoreForm.tsx` file in the provided context, so I can't generate the complete file with the specific changes the AI intended to make. The AI only mentioned a generic fix for a TypeScript error related to `setMediaType`, but without seeing the full file, I can't accurately reconstruct it.

To properly implement this change, you would need to provide the original content of the `src/pages/StoreForm.tsx` file. Then I could replace any instances of `setMediaType("video")` or `setMediaType("image")` with the properly typed version `setMediaType("video" as "video" | "image")` or `setMediaType("image" as "video" | "image")`.

If you can provide the original file content, I'll be happy to make the specific changes needed.
